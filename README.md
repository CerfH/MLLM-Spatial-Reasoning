# MLLM-Spatial-Reasoning
Exploring and Enhancing Spatial Reasoning Capabilities in Multimodal Large Language Models.

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the **2026 Undergraduate Innovation and Entrepreneurship Training Program** at Nanjing University. We focus on diagnosing and bridging the "perception-reasoning gap" in state-of-the-art MLLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL, LLaVA).

## 🚀 Key Objectives
- **Error Diagnosis**: Identifying failure modes in spatial position sensing and logical deduction.
- **Benchmark Evaluation**: Testing models on benchmarks like SpatialScore and MathVista.
- **Optimization**: Exploring improved visual encoding and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.

## 🛠️ Status
- [x] Literature Review & Baseline Selection
- [ ] Systematic Error Analysis (In Progress)
- [ ] Model Fine-tuning/Prompt Engineering
